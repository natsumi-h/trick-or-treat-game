## Breakdown of the components

### Variables
* There are variables to track the gameâ€™s status, the score, charactersâ€™ positions, etc.
Lists to hold instances of ghosts, candies, and lollipops.

### Constants:
* The constants `charSize`, `candyInterval`, `lollipopInterval`, and `zIndex` define various game settings.
* `ghostSpeed` and `ghostInterval` are defined as functions that return values based on the game's difficulty `level`.

### Character Classes
* Character is the base class used to create other game characters, such as ghosts, treats (candy and lollipop), and pumpkins.
* `Ghost`, `Treat`, and `Pumpkin` classes extend Character, each implementing its own specific behaviors and interactions within the game.

### Event Listeners
* Event listeners are added to the game board to handle pointer (mouse or touch) interactions, like moving the Hero and grabbing the treats.

### Game Logic
* There are several functions implementing game logic, including `showTreats`, `showPumpkin`, and `showGhosts`, which handle the creation and updating of game items and characters.
* `updateItems` updates the positions of items, and checks for collision with the hero.
* `handleGameOver` sets the game status to over and updates the user interface accordingly.

### Collision Detection
* The code checks for collisions between the Hero and other game characters using the distance formula in a 2D plane, which is basically a simplified version of the Pythagorean theorem.
* If a collision with a ghost is detected, the game is over.
